# CIT 281 lab 09

## Outcome:

This lab taught us the release based workflow which is extremely important with version control and new releases.   
This lab required us to download the GitHub learning lab repo inorder to complete this course from out GitHub accounts.   
In this lab we were given some files to update and slowly stage changes for a release and hotfixes afterwards.
